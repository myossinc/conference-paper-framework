Paste the appropriate copyright statement here. ACM now supports three different
copyright statements:
• ACM copyright: ACM holds the copyright on the work. This is the historical
approach.
• License: The author(s) retain copyright, but ACM receives an exclusive
publication license.
• Open Access: The author(s) wish to pay for the work to be open access. The
additional fee must be paid to ACM.
This text field is large enough to hold the appropriate release statement assuming it is
single spaced in a sans-serif 7 point font.
Every submission will be assigned their own unique DOI string to be included here.
Abstract
UPDATED—August 31, 2015. This sample paper describes
the formatting requirements for SIGCHI Extended Abstract
Format, and this sample file offers recommendations on
writing for the worldwide SIGCHI readership. Please review
this document even if you have submitted to SIGCHI confer-
ences before, as some format details have changed relative
to previous years. Abstracts should be about 150 words.
Required.
Author Keywords
Authors’ choice; of terms; separated; by semicolons; in-
clude commas, within terms only; required.
ACM Classification Keywords

Miscellaneous; See [http://acm.org/about/class/1998/]: for full
list of ACM classifiers. This section is required.
Introduction
This format is to be used for submissions that are published
in the conference publications. We wish to give this volume
a consistent, high-quality appearance. We therefore ask
that authors follow some simple guidelines. In essence, you
should format your paper exactly like this document. The
easiest way to do this is to replace the content with your
own material.
ACM Copyrights & Permission
Accepted extended abstracts and papers will be distributed
in the Conference Publications. They will also be placed in
the ACM Digital Library, where they will remain accessible
to thousands of researchers and practitioners worldwide.
To view the ACM’s copyright and permissions policy, see:
http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy.
Good Utilization of the Side
Bar
Preparation: Do not change
the margin dimensions and
do not flow the margin text to
the next page.
Materials: The margin box
must not intrude or overflow
into the header or the footer,
or the gutter space between
the margin paragraph and
the main left column. The
text in this text box should
remain the same size as the
body text. Use the \vspace
command to set the margin
note’s position.
Images & Figures: Practi-
cally anything can be put in
the margin if it fits. Use the
\marginparwidth constant
to set the width of the figure,
table, minipage, or whatever
you are trying to fit in this
skinny space.
Page Size
All SIGCHI submissions should be US letter (8.5 × 11
inches). US Letter is the standard option used by this LATEX
template.
Text Formatting
Please use an 8.5-point Verdana font, or other sans serifs
font as close as possible in appearance to Verdana in which
these guidelines have been set. Arial 9-point font is a rea-
sonable substitute for Verdana as it has a similar x-height.
Please use serif or non-proportional fonts only for special
purposes, such as distinguishing source code text.
Text styles
The LATEX template facilitates text formatting for normal (for
body text); heading 1, heading 2, heading 3; bullet list; num-
bered list; caption; annotation (for notes in the narrow left
margin); and references (for bibliographic entries). Addition-
ally, here is an example of footnoted1 text. As stated in the
footnote, footnotes should rarely be used.
Language, style, and content
The written and spoken language of SIGCHI is English.
Spelling and punctuation may use any dialect of English
(e.g., British, Canadian, US, etc.) provided this is done con-
sistently. Hyphenation is optional. To ensure suitability for
1Use footnotes sparingly, if at all.

an international audience, please pay attention to the fol-
lowing:
• Write in a straightforward style. Use simple sentence
structure. Try to avoid long sentences and complex
sentence structures. Use semicolons carefully.
• Use common and basic vocabulary (e.g., use the
word “unusual” rather than the word “arcane”).
• Briefly define or explain all technical terms. The ter-
minology common to your practice/discipline may be
different in other design practices/disciplines.
• Spell out all acronyms the first time they are used in
your text. For example, “World Wide Web (WWW)”.
• Explain local references (e.g., not everyone knows all
city names in a particular country).
• Explain “insider” comments. Ensure that your whole
audience understands any reference whose meaning
you do not describe (e.g., do not assume that every-
one has used a Macintosh or a particular application).
• Explain colloquial language and puns. Understanding
phrases like “red herring” requires a cultural knowl-
edge of English. Humor and irony are difficult to
translate.
• Use unambiguous forms for culturally localized con-
cepts, such as times, dates, currencies, and numbers
(e.g., “1-5- 97” or “5/1/97” may mean 5 January or
1 May, and “seven o’clock” may mean 7:00 am or
19:00). For currencies, indicate equivalences: “Partic-
ipants were paid₩ 25,000, or roughly US $22.”
• Be careful with the use of gender-specific pronouns
(he, she) and other gender-specific words (chair-
man, manpower, man-months). Use inclusive lan-
guage (e.g., she or he, they, chair, staff, staff-hours,
person-years) that is gender-neutral. If necessary,
you may be able to use “he” and “she” in alternating
sentences, so that the two genders occur equally of-
ten [9].
• If possible, use the full (extended) alphabetic charac-
ter set for names of persons, institutions, and places
(e.g., Grønbæk, Lafreniére, Sánchez, Nguyê˜n, Uni-
versität, Weißenbach, Züllighoven, Århus, etc.). These
characters are already included in most versions and
variants of Times, Helvetica, and Arial fonts.

are tessellated within a square
frame. Images should also have
captions and be within the
boundaries of the sidebar on
page 2. Photo: cz jofish on

Figures
The examples on this and following pages should help you
get a feel for how screen-shots and other figures should be
placed in the template. Your document may use color fig-
ures (see Figures 1), which are included in the page limit;
the figures must be usable when printed in black and white.
You can use the command to insert figures in the (left)
margin of the document (see Figure 2). Finally, be sure to
make images large enough so the important details are leg-
ible and clear (see Figure 3).
Tables
You man use tables inline with the text (see Table 1) or
within the margin as shown in Table 2. Try to minimize the
use of lines (especially vertical lines). LATEX will set the ta-
ble font and captions sizes correctly; the latter must remain
unchanged.
Accessibility
The Executive Council of SIGCHI has committed to making
SIGCHI conferences more inclusive for researchers, prac-
titioners, and educators with disabilities. As a part of this
goal, the all authors are asked to work on improving the ac-
cessibility of their submissions. Specifically, we encourage
authors to carry out the following five steps:
• Add alternative text to all figures
• Mark table headings
• Generate a tagged PDF
• Verify the default language
• Set the tab order to “Use Document Structure”
For links to instructions and resources, please see: http:
//chi2016.acm.org/accessibility
Unfortunately good tools do not yet exist to create tagged
PDF files from Latex. LATEX users will need to carry out all
of the above steps in the PDF directly using Adobe Acrobat,
after the PDF has been generated.
For more information and links to instructions and resources,
please see: http://chi2016.acm.org/accessibility.
Figure 3: In this image, the map maximizes use of space. You can make figures as wide as you need, up to a maximum of the full width of
both columns. Note that LATEX tends to render large figures on a dedicated page. Image: cbd ayman on Flickr.
Producing and Testing PDF Files
We recommend that you produce a PDF version of your
submission well before the final deadline. Your PDF file
must be ACM DL Compliant and meet stated requirements,

So long as you don’t type out-
side the right margin or bleed
into the gutter, it’s okay to put
annotations over here on the
left, too; this annotation is near
Hawaii. You’ll have to manually
align the margin paragraphs
to your LATEX floats using the
\vspace command.

Test your PDF file by viewing or printing it with the same
software we will use when we receive it, Adobe Acrobat
Reader Version 10. This is widely available at no cost. Note
that most reviewers will use a North American/European
version of Acrobat reader, so please check your PDF ac-
cordingly.
Acknowledgements
We thank all the volunteers, publications support, staff, and
authors who wrote and provided helpful comments on pre-
vious versions of this document. As well authors 1, 2, and 3
gratefully acknowledge the grant from NSF (#1234–2222–
ABC). Author 4 for example may want to acknowledge a su-
pervisor/manager from their original employer. This whole
paragraph is just for example. Some of the references cited
in this paper are included for illustrative purposes only.
References Format
Your references should be published materials accessible
to the public. Internal technical reports may be cited only
if they are easily accessible and may be obtained by any
reader for a nominal fee. Proprietary information may not be
cited. Private communications should be acknowledged in
the main text, not referenced (e.g., [Golovchinsky, personal
communication]). References must be the same font size
as other body text. References should be in alphabetical
order by last name of first author. Use a numbered list of
references at the end of the article, ordered alphabetically
by last name of first author, and referenced by numbers in
brackets. For papers from conference proceedings, include
the title of the paper and the name of the conference. Do
not include the location of the conference or the exact date;
do include the page numbers if available.
References should be in ACM citation format: http://www.
acm.org/publications/submissions/latex_style. This includes ci-
tations to Internet resources [4, 3, 8] according to ACM for-
mat, although it is often appropriate to include URLs directly
in the text, as above. Example reference formatting for in-
dividual journal articles [2], articles in conference proceed-
ings [7], books [9], theses [10], book chapters [11], an en-
tire journal issue [6], websites [1, 3], tweets [4], patents [5],
and online videos [8] is given here. See the examples of
citations at the end of this document and in the accompa-
nying BibTeX document. This formatting is a edited version
of the format automatically generated by the ACM Digital Li-
brary (http://dl.acm.org) as “ACM Ref”. DOI and/or URL links
are optional but encouraged as are full first names. Note
that the Hyperlink style used throughout this document
uses blue links; however, URLs in the references section
may optionally appear in black.
