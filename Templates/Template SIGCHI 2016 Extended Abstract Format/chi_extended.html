	<!-- CONTENT -->
	<div>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>This format is to be used for submissions that are published in the conference publications. We wish to give this volume a consistent, high-quality appearance. We therefore ask that authors follow some simple guidelines. In essence, you should format your paper exactly like this document. The easiest way to do this is to replace the content with your own material.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>ACM Copyrights & Permission Policy</h2>
		<p>Accepted extended abstracts and papers will be distributed in the Conference Publications. They will also be placed in the ACM Digital Library, where they will remain accessible to thousands of researchers and practitioners worldwide. To view ACM’s copyright and permissions policy, see: <a class="link-separate" href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy">http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy</a></p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Page Size</h2>
		<p>All SIGCHI submissions should be US letter (8.5x11 inches) and not A4. US Letter is a standard option on all versions of Microsoft Word, as well as most other document preparation programs.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Text Formatting</h2>
		<p>Please use an 8.5-point Verdana font, or other sans serifs font as close as possible in appearance to Verdana in which these guidelines have been set. (The “Normal” style for this document automatically gives you this font setting.) Arial 9-point font is a reasonable substitute for Verdana as it has a similar x-height. Please use serif or non-proportional fonts only for special purposes, such as distinguishing source code text.</p>

		<div>
			<h3>Text styles</h3>
			<p>The template uses MS Word text styles to facilitate text formatting, and we highly recommend you use these Styles instead of manually applying formatting. The applicable text styles are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Normal—for body text. Don’t use “Default Paragraph Font”.</li>
				<li>Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3</li>
				<li>Bullet list</li>
				<li>Numbered list</li>
				<li>Caption</li>
				<li>References—for bibliographic entries</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<p>Additionally, here is an example of footnoted text.  (The footnote is created with the “footnote…” command under the “Insert” menu in MS Word). As stated in the footnote, footnotes should rarely be used.</p>

		<div>
			<h3>Language, style and content</h3>
			<p>The written and spoken language of SIGCHI is English. Spelling and punctuation may use any dialect of English (e.g., British, Canadian, US, etc.) provided this is done consistently. Hyphenation is optional. To ensure suitability for an international audience, please pay attention to the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Write in a straightforward style. Try to avoid long sentences and complex sentence structures. Use semicolons carefully.</li>
				<li>Use common and basic vocabulary (e.g., use the word “unusual” rather than the word “arcane”).</li>
				<li>Briefly define or explain all technical terms. The terminology common to your practice/discipline may be different in other design practices/disciplines.</li>
				<li>Explain all acronyms the first time they are used in your text—e.g., “Digital Signal Processing (DSP)”.</li>
				<li>Explain local references (e.g., not everyone knows all city names in a particular country).</li>
				<li>Explain “insider” comments. Ensure that your whole audience understands any reference whose meaning you do not describe (e.g., do not assume that everyone has used an Android phone or a particular application).</li>
				<li>Explain colloquial language and puns. Understanding phrases like “red herring” requires a cultural knowledge of English. Humor and irony are difficult to translate.</li>
				<li>Use unambiguous forms for culturally localized concepts, such as times, dates, currencies, and numbers (e.g., “1-5- 97” or “5/1/97” may mean 5 January or 1 May, and “seven o’clock” may mean 7:00 am or 19:00). For currencies, indicate equivalences: “Participants were paid ₩22, or roughly US$29.”</li>
				<li>Be careful with the use of gender-specific pronouns (he, she) and other gendered words (chairman, manpower, man-months). Use inclusive language that is gender-neutral (e.g., she or he, they, s/he, chair, staff, staff-hours, person-years). See the Guidelines for Bias-Free Writing for further advice and examples regarding gender and other personal attributes [9]. Be particularly aware of considerations around writing about people with disabilities. </li>
				<li>If possible, use the full (extended) alphabetic character set for names of persons, institutions, and places (e.g., Grønbæk, Lafreniére, Sánchez, Nguyễn, Universität, Weißenbach, Züllighoven, Århus, etc.). These characters are already included in most versions and variants of Times, Helvetica, and Arial fonts.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Figures and Tables</h2>
		<p>The examples on this and following pages should help you get a feel for how screen-shots and other figures should be placed in the template. <strong>Be sure to make images large enough so the important details are legible and clear.</strong> Your document may use color figures, which are included in the page limit; the figures must be usable when printed in black and white.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="./img/chi_extended_figure1.gif" alt="Colored SIGCHI Logo">
			<figcaption>Insert a caption below each figure. We suggest selecting the image and then using Insert, Caption. Then if you use Insert, Cross-Reference then your Figure numbering referencing will be consistent. Make sure you use the Caption style for text formatting.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>If you aren’t familiar with Word’s handling of pictures, we offer one tip: the “format picture” dialog is the key to controlling position of pictures and the flow of text around them. You access these controls by selecting your picture, then choosing “Picture…” from the “Format” menu. As for the “picture” tab in that dialog, we recommend using Photoshop, Preview, or other graphics software to scale images, rather than scaling them after you have placed them in Word.</p>

		<table>
			<caption>
				Tables should have the caption below. Use Table – SIGCHI style. Use 0.75 rules/borders at 75% grey for your tables, align decimals or center text in the cells. For improved accessibility, header rows of tables should be marked. In Word, right click a header row, and select Table Properties | Row | Repeat as header at the top of each page. Avoid spurious decimal points
			</caption>

			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Objects</th>
					<th>Caption – pre-2002</th>
					<th>Caption – 2003 and beyond</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>

			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<th>Tables</th>
					<td>Above</td>
					<td>Below</td>

				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>

		<figure>
			<img src="./img/chi_extended_figure3.png" alt="Map of the world with info about something">
			<figcaption>You can make figures as wide as you need, up to a maximum of the full width of both columns. To achieve this, select the figure and the caption, choose “columns” under the  “Format” menu, pick the “One” (single column) icon at the top of the dialog, and make sure you are making the change only for “selected text” (at the bottom of the dialog).

		<p>Page 5 shows a treatment of large figures, too big to fit inside a single column of text. All figures should include alt text for improved accessibility. In Word, right click the figure, and select Format Picture | Alt Text).</p>

		<h2>Accessibility</h2>
		<p>The Executive Council of SIGCHI has committed to making SIGCHI conferences more inclusive for researchers, practitioners, and educators with disabilities. As a part of this goal, the all authors are asked to work on improving the accessibility of their submissions. Specifically, we encourage authors to carry out the following five steps:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Add alternative text to all figures</li>
			<li>Mark table headings</li>
			<li>Generate a tagged PDF</li>
			<li>Verify the default language</li>
			<li>Set the tab order to <q>Use Document Structure</q></li>
		</ol>

		<p>For links to instructions and resourses, please see:	<a class="link-separate" href="http://chi2016.acm.org/accessibility">http://chi2016.acm.org/accessibility</a>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Producing and Testing PDF Files</h2>
		<p>We recommend that you produce a PDF version of your submission well before the final deadline.  Your PDF file must be ACM DL Compliant. Requirements are at: <a class="link-separate" href="http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/ACM-distilling-settings.htm">http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/ACM-distilling-settings.htm</a> Test your PDF file by viewing or printing it with the same software the publisher will use, Adobe Acrobat Reader Version 10, which is widely available at no cost. Note that most reviewers will use a North American/European version of Acrobat Reader, so please check your PDF accordingly.</p>

		<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
		<p>We thank all the volunteers, publications support, staff, and authors who wrote and provided helpful comments on previous versions of this document. As well authors 1, 2, & 3 gratefully acknowledge the grant from NSF (#1234-2222-ABC). Author 4 for example may want to acknowledge a supervisor/manager from their original employer. This whole paragraph is just for example. Some of the references cited in this paper are included for illustrative purposes only.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>References Format</h2>
		<p>Your references should be published materials accessible to the public. Internal technical reports may be cited only if they are easily accessible (i.e., you provide the address for obtaining the report within your citation) and may be obtained by any reader for a nominal fee. Proprietary information may not be cited. Private communications should be acknowledged in the main text, not referenced  (e.g., “[Golovchinsky, personal communication]”).</p>
		<p>User a numbered list of references at the end of the article, ordered alphabetically by first last name of first author. References must be the same font size as other body text. References should be in alphabetical order by last name of first author. Format your references like the examples in this document. Example reference formatting for individual journal articles 3, an entire journal special issue 6, websites 14, tweets 1, patents 5, articles in conference proceedings 7, videos 8, books 9, theses 10 and book chapters 11 is given here. This formatting is a slightly abbreviated version of the format automatically generated by the ACM Digital Library <a href="http://dl.acm.org">http://dl.acm.org</a> as “ACM Ref”: the easiest method is to look the reference up in the Digital Library, click on the ACM Ref link, and cut and paste the result and edit to match the examples. More details of reference formatting are available at: <a class="link-separate" href="http://acm.org/publications/submissions/latex_style">http://acm.org/publications/submissions/latex_style</a> Note that the hyperlink style used throughout this document uses blue links; however, URLs that appear in the references section may appear in black.</p>

		<p class="sidebar"><em>Preparation:</em> Do not change the text box size or position. Do copy text box to other pages. You may change the surrounding box to be visible or invisible, up to you. </p>

		<p class="sidebar"><em>Materials:</em>  This cannot appear higher or lower on the page because of pagination and specific headers added during the indexing and pagination process. A 0.75 inch rule is beneficial to break this apart from the body text. The text in this text box should remain the same size as the Body Text: 8.5 Verdana or Arial (with use of <em>bold</em> and <strong>italics</strong> to highlight points)</p>
